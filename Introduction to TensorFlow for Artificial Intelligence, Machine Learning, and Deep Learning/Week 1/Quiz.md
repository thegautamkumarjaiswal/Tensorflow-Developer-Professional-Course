> **A layer of connected neurons**

### Question 5: What does a Loss function do?

> **Measures how good the current ‘guess’ is**
* Generates a guess
* Decides to stop training a neural network
* Figures out if you win or lose

### Question 6: What does the optimizer do?

* Figures out how to efficiently compile your code
> **Measures how good the current guess is**
* Decides to stop training a neural network
* Generates a new and improved guess

### Question 7: What is Convergence?

* The bad guys in the next ‘Star Wars’ movie
* A programming API for AI
* A dramatic increase in loss
> **The process of getting very close to the correct answer**

### Question 8: What does model.fit do?

* It optimizes an existing model
* It makes a model fit available memory
> **It determines if your activity is good for your body**
* It trains the neural network to fit one set of values to another
