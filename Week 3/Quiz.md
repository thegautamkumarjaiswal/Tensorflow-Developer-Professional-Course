### Question 1: What is a Convolution?

* A technique to isolate features in images
* A technique to filter out unwanted images
* **A technique to make images bigger**
* A technique to make images smaller

### Question 2: What is a Pooling?

* A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features
* A technique to make images sharper
* A technique to combine pictures
* **A technique to isolate features in images**

### Question 3: How do Convolutions improve image recognition?

* They make the image smaller
* They isolate features in images
* **They make processing of images faster**
* They make the image clearer

### Question 4: After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?

* 25x25
* 31x31
* **26x26**
* 28x28

### Question 5: After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?

* 56x56
* **13x13**
* 26x26
* 28x28

### Question 6: Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:

* It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
* Faster
* Stay the same
* **Slower**
