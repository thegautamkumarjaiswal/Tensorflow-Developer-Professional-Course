# Course 1: Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
This course is part of the upcoming Machine Learning in Tensorflow Specialization and will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. 

The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems.

## Week 1: A New Programming Paradigm
Welcome to this course on going from Basics to Mastery of TensorFlow. We're excited you're here! In week 1 you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along.

* Introduction: A conversation with Andrew Ng
* A primer in machine learning
* The “Hello World” of neural networks
* Working through “Hello World” in TensorFlow and Python
* Lab Exercise - Predicting Housing Price

## Week 2: Introduction to Computer Vision
You’re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code!

* A conversation with Andrew Ng
* An introduction to computer vision
* Writing code to load training data
* Coding a computer vision neural network
* Walk through a notebook for computer vision
* Using callbacks to control training
* Walk through a notebook with callbacks
* Lab Excercise - Classifying Fashion MNIST with MLP

## Week 3: Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks
WE will go more deeper in CNN.

* A conversation with Andrew Ng
* What are convolutions and pooling?
* Implementing convolutional layers
* Implementing pooling layers
* Improving the fashion classifier with convolutions
* Walking through convolutions
* Lab Excercise - Classifying Fashion MNIST with CNN

## Week 4: Using Real-World Images
Last week you saw how to improve the results from your deep neural network using convolutions. It was a good start, but the data you used was very basic. What happens when your images are larger, or if the features aren’t always in the same place? Andrew and Laurence discuss this to prepare you for what you’ll learn this week: handling complex images!

* A conversation with Andrew Ng
* Understanding ImageGenerator
* Defining a ConvNet to use complex images
* Training the ConvNet with fit_generator
* Walking through developing a ConvNet
* Walking through training the ConvNet with fit_generator
* Adding automatic validation to test accuracy
* Exploring the impact of compressing images
* Outro: Conversation with Andrew
* Lab Excercise - Classifying emotion with CNN
