# DeepLearning.AI : Tensorflow Developer Professional Course.
TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. The DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program teaches you applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so you can build and train powerful models. 

In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, you’ll learn the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. After finishing this program, you’ll be able to apply your new TensorFlow skills to a wide range of problems and projects. This program can help you prepare for the Google TensorFlow Certificate exam and bring you one step closer to achieving the Google TensorFlow Certificate.


## Course 1: Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
This course is part of the upcoming Machine Learning in Tensorflow Specialization and will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. 

The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems.

* Week 1: A New Programming Paradigm
* Week 2: Introduction to Computer Vision
* Week 3: Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks
* Week 4: Using Real-World Images


## Course 2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.

* Week 1: Exploring a Larger Dataset
* Week 2: Augmentation, a Technique to Avoid Overfitting
* Week 3: Transfer Learning
* Week 4: Multi-class Classifications


## Course 3: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
In this third course, you’ll learn how to apply neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow. You’ll learn how to process and represent text through tokenization so that it’s recognizable by a neural network. You’ll be introduced to new types of neural networks, including RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs, and how you can train them to understand the meaning of text. Finally, you’ll learn how to train LSTMs on existing text to create original poetry and more!

* Week 1: Sentiment in Text
* Week 2: Word Embeddings
* Week 3: Sequence Models
* Week 4: Sequence Models and Literature
